# Introduction

Many infectious diseases are directly transmitted from infectious to susceptible individuals.  

Infectious disease dynamics are characterized by the complex interactions of susceptible and infectious individuals in a population. These interactions are often represented using a compartmental model, such as the Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered, or SIR, model, which allows an individual in a population to be in one (or more) states at any particular time, and defines possible individual paths through the disease system. 

These models of disease spread may be represented mathematically by differential equations, and have been for close to 100 years. By studing different possible parameterizations of these models, either numerically (via simulation) or theoretically, we may gain insights into the complex dynamics of real-world disease systems. 

A classic formulation of infectious disease dynamics assumes that the number of new infectious individuals at time $t$ has a non-linear relationship with the number of infectious individals and susceptible individuals at the previous time step. 

Using SIR-style models of disease transmission to estimate parameters of interest has been an active area of research for decades. One of the central challenges faced by all statistical approaches for analyzing this type of data is the inherent difficulty in observing the susceptible population. In a limited set of special cases (e.g. an outbreak in a closed population), the susceptible population may be known exactly. But more commonly, in the ever-changing populations of countries, states, provinces, etc..., it can be very difficult to ascertain directly the fraction of the population that is susceptible to disease at any given time. Yet, to fit something that approximates the "true" model to observed data, susceptibility must be included or estimated in the model fitting procedure. 

In the past few decades, several frameworks for analyzing time-series data from these systems have been proposed, each with a different method for including and/or estimating susceptibility. An early example was the time-series SIR model [Finkenstadt and Grenfell], which used XXX. More recently, a framework for estimation of partially observed Markov processes [cite King et al] uses particle filtering and sequential monte carlo techniques to estimate susceptibility., and an endemic-epidemic framework [Held et al.], to name a few.  

In some infectious disease settings, multiple different pathogens or multiple strains of a single pathogen compete to infect susceptible individuals in a population. This competition can drive systems into complex and chaotic dynamics[[ref]]. Observed data from these multi-pathogen systems has proved difficult to analyze effectively and efficiently, due in large part to the complexity of the interactions between pathogens. 

Complex mechanistic models of disease systems require computationally intensive algorithms to fit to real data, and can have prohibitively long computation time [cite sourya]. Simpler more phenomenological models for the disease process can often be fitted to data using less intensive statistical methods. But these simple methods may suffer from bias (since the disease model may not be accurately specified) and may not appropriately account for all of the uncertainty and noise in the disease system. Finding the right balance of model complexity so that these models are conceptually and computationally tractable while remaining faithful to the biological system in question is an area of research that remains largely unexplored.[[cite fisheries pubs from grant]] Work in this area could have a large impact in infectious disease modeling research and potentially in other fields that generate multivariate time series data with complex interactions.

One prominent example of a multi-pathogen disease system is dengue fever, a mosquito-borne arbovirus that infects an estimated 400 million individuals worldwide each year [TSIR 9]. The dengue virus has four identifiable serotypes. Infection with one serotype is thought to confer permanent immunity to that serotype and temporary cross-protection against infection with other serotypes.[Sabin 1952, Reich 2013] However after this temporary protection wanes, individuals are thought to be at increased risk of severe disease when infected with a different serotype.[burke et al 1988] In recent years there has been a substantial increased interest in using infectious disease models to understand interactions between pathogens. [TSIR grant citations: 15,16,22-28] Some of this research on the dynamics of dengue in different geographical locations has demonstrated that complex dynamics observed in data are consistent with the presence of cross-protection and immune enhancement [more citations].  However, very few research teams have used data to explicitly estimate characteristics such as cross-protection or immune enhancement.
